My work with Claude has been exciting! It's opened up a new level of inspiration. I had been in a bit of a lull, as far as being creative. I decided to archive all of my conversations, as an academic archive. I think it lends itself to how well I communicate as a prompt engineer, and there's a potential work portfolio element to it. Nonetheless, I'm interested in writing about my experiences.

It's called the AI Architecture Lab. I chose Claude by Anthropic because of their commitment to efficiency over blunt force expansion. They have also committed to keeping advertising out of their AI, recently. I still work with Claude but, some questions were raised as I tried to build out this site. I was always open to other platforms but, I felt almost forced to use Copilot (embedded in VS Code). 

I still have a lot of archiving to do. I don't know if I'll build an entire website for it. I may be satisfied with the page on this site, and just link to the GitHub Repo. I'm still thinking about it.
