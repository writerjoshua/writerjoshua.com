It's been a little frustrating, tbh. Claude was able to build most of the code for this (and another similar site) but, I ran into some logic issues. Maybe it's because I was using Haiku but, it sort of outsmarted itself, and found it hard to keep track of the html, css, and js and how they all interacted. 

Luckily, I discovered that VS Code now has AI built in. It helped me to sort things out within the context of the code. It's got it's own limits, as far as usage, and I'm not certain on their token efficiency but, it is quite impressive. There's still work to be done, and I'll have to wait for my limit period to continue but, I have high hopes.
