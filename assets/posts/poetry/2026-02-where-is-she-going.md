title: Where Is She Going?

And in such a hurry
I watch from her bank
Smooth stones under foot
Some sit still 
Just below the surface 
At my feet

I lose myself in the soothing sound
Of her effortless climb downward
The rocks and trees seem to applaud
Her gentle tenacity to carry on
They don’t even need to move
Out of her way 

Her wondrous power acknowledged
But presenting itself in restraint
Her destructive potential respected
Evermore in her peaceful embrace
All energy is connected 

I look up from my seat
Just a witness at her parade
I follow as if I floated along
A paper boat in her wake

As I peer across her body
Northwest as she goes
Her body gets smaller and smaller 
Before disappearing behind
A mysterious further away

While I can still look down
To her place at my feet
I can’t help but wonder
Where is she going?
And in such a hurry?
What is it in nature
That would ever make her leave?

That’s when I remember the sea
The cycle of her,
Raindrop on the mountain 
Love filling my cup
From deep underground 
I’m bubbling up
For her
I am sprung 

She goes but, she’s here
She nourishes me
Cleanses me
Relaxes me
And does so across every state line
I’ve traveled through

At any latitude
In any temperature 
On this planet
And maybe others
She gives life

I looked up from my pen
Away from this thought
Let myself soar with the birds
Sipped from my mug
Contemplating all that she is
In celebration of all that she was

That’s when I realized
I was in love
I was pondering a woman 
Made of water and light
Naturally beautiful 
As if the universe was her
And she was

She Is
