### Likes, Shares, and Engagement are valuable to your brand but, only so much as they drive traffic to it.

Leveraging a high level of engagement on social media is at its most valuable when it leads to conversion, to clicks on the links you publish. 

Trust me, I was caught up in the hype, too. When everyone gathers in one place, marketing is easy. Everywhere you turn, you find a potential lead. It was a small business lead generation paradise. Algorithms were designed to appropriate that 'marketplace' sentiment. That was the early days of the internet. 

Now, they shadowban everyone who isn't actively beneficial to their bottom line. 

*Who are they?*

They are the owners of the domains that your favorite 'app' lives on. It's not to say that you can't connect with like-minded people. Those apps wouldn't survive if they outright disconnected everyone from each other. So, it's not impossible to build brand awareness with social media but, it's not the option that it still presents itself to be. 

So, who does your likes and followers count benefit the most? If it's not driving traffic to what your brand is developing, than it benefits them. If users never actually leave that site, and come to yours, it's lost most of it's value.

There is a case to be made for brand awareness, and trust building, and all of the less tangible qualities to pursue but, for independent business, it's becoming more useless with every algorithm update that prioritizes advertisers, and 'influencers.' 

So, what can you do?

It's not totally hopeless. While there are still questions about the value of traditional SEO (Search Engine Optimazation), such as flooidng keywords, manufactured traffic, and paid advertisement, I believe that your next valuable lead can come from leveraging the world wide web's old standard: text content.

While the shift from traditional search to AI chat is happening as I type, even those agents are searching the web with the same protocols. There is reason to be concerned about the same algorithm biases that killed social media equity, such as ads in AI (OpenAI is testing ads in ChatGPT), or promoted content. From what I can tell, though, they seem to be logical about searching content, so far.

Assuming that the internet remains free (hell, even if it doesn't), the best practice for establishing a brand online is in comprehensive content. That content can exist on social media but, it should come from your brand's own domain.

### 1. Own Your Domain
Think about how many active users visit the biggest sites. If you're researching this far, I'm sure you're aware of this metric. What social media has done, is hijack web traffic. When everyone is visiting the same site for their entire internet experience, they are neglecting the rest of the web. That's why they leverage an internal browser, so even when the content comes from outside their domain, they leverage that traffic.

Aside from what esssentially amounts to bragging rights, you want traffic to your website becuase it signals interest in your brand and offers a legitimacy to your content. Imagine the value of real estate being on a busy street. You're more likely to convert sales if your shop is set up where there are more people. Unfortunately, this is where marketing and ad companies see value, as well. They will lure you into exploiting your traffic by offering pennies per click. That's up to you but, there is much more value to generating traffic than becoming a billboard.

### 2. Build Your Own Content
It's one thing to generate traffic but, it's another to provide value to that traffic, once they reach your brand's website. What makes a visitor stay? Your content should reflect the quality of your brand's products, or services. Search engines prioritize active screen time, such as having plenty of engaging text ,and related content, where users click links to other pages within your website, and backlinks, where other websites are linked to your content, and vice-versa. 

We'll get more into these topics in the next point. The key takeaway is providing quality content that reflects your brand. It might be tempting to use generative AI, or to load up a few paragraphs with keywords but, the average visitor is going to see through a lazy attempt. I've clicked on too many websites to mentions that felt promising but, were simply search ranking hijackers, with no relevant content at best. At worst, they were laced with unsafe links. Do well to set yourself apart from those kinds of websites and quality customers will keep that in mind.

### 3. Prioritize SEO and Backlinks
As I mentioned before, Search Engine Optimization can help your brand reach audiences who are already searching for what you offer. Use keywords that are relevant to your product, or service. You can use sites like Google Trends to research your brand and cross-reference related words. Don't just dump all the keywords into your headline but, make note of the ones you're not using, yet. Focus on generating relevant content in that direction.

Search Engine rankings primarily count visits but, there are other factors to consider. They also look at links to other websites. Think of these as referrals. When another website links to yours, such as a featured blog post about your product, this counts towards your ranking as well. So, network with likeminded publications to generate your network. 

I want to keep this as simple as possible but, there are more technical measures you can take to levarage SEO. While some webhosting products provide options, if you're building from scratch, or have access to the code, there are certain variables you can use to further optimize, like using bullet points, and effective headers to organize content. Think of it like, making it easier for the search engines to understand your webpages. Search (or ask your AI) SEO and see what else you can learn. 

### 4. Use Socials Efficiently
Given that the trend in social media algorithms have severely weakened your opportunity to capitalize on the 'public marketplace' that it once was, you should focus more of your attention, elsewhere. Like I mentioned before, it's not a total loss. You can still communicate directly with potential customers and allies but, 'going viral' isn't possible, anymore. Think of trends on social media, going forward, as more a professional wrestling stunt, than a legitimate boxing contest. There may be actual talent, there but, it's scripted to benefit whoever put their money up, and creating a narrative.

Therefore, don't spend too much time vying for exposure. It's fruitless. Instead, treat your feed more like a resume of your brand's work. You're not begging for the world's attention, you're simply creating a menu of what your brand is capable of delivering. When someone looks at your profile, make sure what you want them to know the most, is featured in your feed. Utilize the pinned post, as well. Don't forget to put your links there, too. 

Next, focus on interacting with people within your sphere. Locate like-minded accounts, verified news, blogs and celebrity accounts (be very suspicious of fakes) and interact with fans in the comments. These conversations should be genuine, and treated as an archive of how your brand operates in the marketplace. Create a sense of interest, so that when users are intrigued, they follow your profile back to your bio, which should include a link to your website.

Paying for interaction is a mixed bag. Advertising can be a crap-shoot, and I don't want to reward this kind of behavior, anyway. So, I don't recommend it but, if you want to, you could find a few new leads that way. The point is, use your time efficiently, and get out. Treat it more like a funnel to your brand's website, instead of the foundation of your brand. Communicating effectively is always a good sign to serious potential customers. 

Don't be afraid to save some value for your website. Use posts as leads. Have something new to show users when they do visit your site. Make your space the main course. Let socials be the appetizers.

### 5. Re-Evaluate Regularly
As I mentioned, there was a time when social media was truly free. It was literally an open air market for the entire world. Creating content and being discovered was an actual possibility. So, going all in was a feasible practice for building brand exposure. However, as we've also discussed, it's no longer viable, in the current environment. It changed quickly.

So, set a standard time frame for examining your strategy and adjusting, based on what you find. It's okay, if at first, you don't see any patterns. Just collect the data. Take note of what's working, and what isn't. Compare that to what you want your brand to look like, and what matters to you but, don't be so rigid that you can't pivot if something looks off. 

Technology is constantly evolving. Do you remember when MySpace changed everything? That wasn't very long ago. Now, look around. AI is changing everything, again, and nobody even knows to what extent that will be, yet. Establish your core values, and have a foundation that stays true to the principles of your brand but, be prepared to adjust, accordingly. Knowing how and when, depends on you're regular re-evaluation so, take a look.
