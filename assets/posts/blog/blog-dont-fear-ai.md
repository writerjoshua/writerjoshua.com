Don't be intimidated by AI

It's easy to see Artificial Intelligence as something brand new. That can be overwhelming, especially if you'r not well versed with computers but, think of it like this: Just like when smartphone technology was invented, when high speed internet, even when the original computer was invented, what's 'new' about this technology is the speed in which it moves.

A computer was fascinating because it did what a calculator does but, many times, quicker, and with less human input. That's all. It is a fancy automated calculator. As technology has advanced, all that's happening, is that they are capable of doing more math, at a higher rate. You might have heard of "1's and Zero's" being computer language. It still is. You line up enough of them in particular order, they make up anything you've ever looked at on a screen.

'AI' is the same technology. What makes it unique is that the hardware driving it is going faster than ever. Hence all the 'data center,' 'hyperscaler' you see in the news as of late. 

This is not to disparage the trend. It truly is very fascinating. I am already leveraging it to enhance some of the knowledge and experience I didn't have, to build, learn, and create like never before. However, it's not a human brain. The 'AI' is not alive, all of a sudden. 

In fact, we've had 'AI' for quite some time. How do you think the self-playing piano worked? How did a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book work? How did Oregon Trail decide if you won the game or not? 

It's a large thread of 'if else' and 'if and' math, coded to language that humans understand that makes it interesting. AI takes input from LLM (Large Language Models), the internet, and from you, and it runs it through these calculations (at remarkable speed, now) and operates much the same way as the old floppy disk games. 

Listen, it's going to change things. The 'logic' is going to revolutionize what is possible but, it's nothing to be intimidated by. If anything, if you didn't know anything about computers and coding, the playing field has just been leveled in your advantage. 

I've never understood how to code, completely. Yet, because I am capable of having a conversation, expressing my ideas, and yes, having some minimal experience with coding, I was able to leverage an AI assistant to build my own blog. As it progresses, it will become even more user friendly.

It's okay to be concerned about the hype. It's legitimately exciting but, it's not quite living up to the dream, just yet. However, I believe it will, and relatively quickly. 

So, instead of worrying about all of the bad potential, start familarizing yourself with the technology. Would you want to be looking for a job, today in 2026, if you didn't know how to use a smartphone, or a calculator? 

Even better, ask your favorite AI how to use it. It can help you with that, too.


All the best,
Josh
